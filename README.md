# MisasMinerSetup
FOR AMD OR NVIDIA GPUs!

This is a simple setup program to start mining.
It currently has advanced settings and it might/will be buggy

Donwload .EXE file from here: http://139.59.147.231/some/MisasMinerSetup.exe

I have heard that it gives false positive trojan virus alerts probably due to the fact that it downloads sgminer if needed.
Currently trying to fix that but if you don't trust me, build the file yourself from the source files.

Downloadable exe will always be the newest version that is listed here.

Instructions:

If you already have sgminer/ccminer, just drop this exe into the same folder as sgminer and start.


If you don't have sgminer/ccminer yet, just run it in a folder where you want the miner folder to be created.
After starting and choosing your gpu you will see "Miner not found" and you can go ahead and press "Install miner".
It will download sgminer and unzip it into a folder called MisasMinerSetup, move the exe there and restart.
After it restarted from the folder, it should be ready to use.

After selecting/writing in you settings, press "RIP GPU" and it will launch a cmd window and it will start to mine.

Settings are saved after shutdown so there is no need to copy paste your wallet everytime you restart.
